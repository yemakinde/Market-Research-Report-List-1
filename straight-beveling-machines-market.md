<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Straight Beveling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Straight beveling machines can be divided into two main types: semi-automatic and automatic. Semi-automatic machines require some manual input from the operator, such as loading and unloading the workpiece, while the beveling process itself is automated. On the other hand, automatic machines are fully self-contained and require minimal or no manual intervention from the operator. These machines are able to perform the entire beveling process independently, making them more efficient and suitable for high-volume production environments.</p></p>
