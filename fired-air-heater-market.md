<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Air Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired</li><li>Indirect Fired</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fired air heaters can be classified into two main types: direct fired and indirect fired. Direct fired heaters have a burner that directly heats the air stream, making them more efficient and suitable for applications requiring high temperatures. Indirect fired heaters, on the other hand, use a heat exchanger to heat a separate air stream, making them safer for applications where direct contact between the burner and air stream may not be desired. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industrial heating applications.</p></p>
