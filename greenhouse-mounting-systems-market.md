<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Greenhouse Mounting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocrystalline</li><li>Polycrystalline</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Greenhouse mounting systems can be classified into two main types based on the type of solar panels they support: monocrystalline and polycrystalline. Monocrystalline panels are made from a single crystal structure, offering higher efficiency and better performance in low light conditions. Polycrystalline panels, on the other hand, are made from multiple silicon crystals and are typically more affordable but slightly less efficient than monocrystalline panels. Both types of panels are commonly used in greenhouse mounting systems for harnessing solar energy.</p></p>
