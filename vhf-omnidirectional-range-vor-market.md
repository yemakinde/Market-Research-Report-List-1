<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR） Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Common VOR</li><li>Doppler VOR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) is a radio navigation system used in aviation. Common VORs utilize ground-based transmitters that emit signals in all directions to help pilots determine their aircraft's bearing relative to the VOR station. This aids in navigation and route tracking. Doppler VORs, on the other hand, employ the Doppler effect to measure the relative velocity between the aircraft and the VOR station. This allows for more precise navigation, especially at higher speeds. Both common and Doppler VORs are important tools for pilots to maintain accurate course and direction during flights.</p></p>
