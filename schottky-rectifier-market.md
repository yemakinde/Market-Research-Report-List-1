<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Schottky Rectifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual</li><li>Single</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Schottky rectifiers are semiconductor devices used in electronic circuits to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). The two main market types of Schottky rectifiers are Dual and Single. Dual Schottky rectifiers have two diodes in a single package, allowing for applications where both positive and negative voltage rectification is needed. Single Schottky rectifiers, on the other hand, have only one diode in a package, commonly used for simpler circuits where only one direction of the current needs to be rectified.</p></p>
