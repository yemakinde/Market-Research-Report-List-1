<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermopile Laser Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Absorber Sensors</li><li>Surface Absorber Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermopile laser sensors are classified into two main types: volume absorber sensors and surface absorber sensors. Volume absorber sensors have a thicker absorber material which allows them to absorb more laser energy and generate a larger output signal. Surface absorber sensors, on the other hand, have a thinner absorber material which makes them more sensitive to changes in laser power. Both types of sensors are commonly used in various industrial applications for measuring laser power and energy.</p></p>
