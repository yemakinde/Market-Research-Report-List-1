<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Reflective Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft-coat Glass</li><li>Hard-coat Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat reflective glass is a type of glass that is designed to reduce the heat transfer from outside to inside a building, minimizing the need for heating or cooling. Soft-coat glass is a type of heat reflective glass that has a thin coating of metal oxide applied to one side, providing high solar control and low reflectivity. Hard-coat glass, on the other hand, has a thicker metal oxide coating that is more durable but less effective in reducing solar heat gain. Both types offer energy efficiency and can be used in various architectural applications.</p></p>
