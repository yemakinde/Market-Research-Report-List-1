<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning Process</li><li>Dry Spinning Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide fibre market can be categorized into two main types - Wet Spinning Process and Dry Spinning Process. Wet spinning involves dissolving polyimide resin in a solvent, then extruding the solution into a coagulating bath to form fibres. On the other hand, dry spinning process entails direct spinning of polyimide precursor solution into fibres through evaporating the solvent. Both processes have their own advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on specific requirements such as fiber properties, production efficiency, and cost considerations.</p></p>
