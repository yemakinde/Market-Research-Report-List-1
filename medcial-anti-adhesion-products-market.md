<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medcial Anti-adhesion Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-adhesion Films</li><li>Anti-adhesion Gels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical anti-adhesion products aim to prevent or reduce the formation of scar tissue and adhesions after surgical procedures. Anti-adhesion films are thin sheets placed between organs or tissues to create a physical barrier, preventing them from sticking together during the healing process. On the other hand, anti-adhesion gels are applied as coatings on the affected area, forming a protective layer that inhibits the adhesion of tissues. Both products help to improve post-operative outcomes and decrease complications associated with surgical adhesions.</p></p>
